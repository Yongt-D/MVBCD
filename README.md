# MVLCD: A Multi-Modal Vision-Language Change Detection Framework with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Remote Sensing
This repository provides code implementations for two innovative frameworks designed for remote sensing building change detection. These frameworks aim to address challenges in:

Complex scene understanding

Accurate boundary detection

Multi-scale feature extraction

Features

Easy-to-use code structure.

Optimized for training on limited labeled data.

Includes tools for evaluation and visualization.

Coming Soon

Full implementation details and pre-trained models will be released upon paper acceptance. Stay tuned for updates!
